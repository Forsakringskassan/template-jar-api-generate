# JAR Client Template

This is a template repository for Java Client projects. The idea is to copy this repository when creating new Java Client projects. Or just as an example of a client, when we need to generate a client inside an application.

## Gradle

This is much like [template-jar](https://github.com/Forsakringskassan/template-jar) but also uses `se.fk.gradle.openapi-generate` plugin from [gradle-conventions](https://github.com/Forsakringskassan/gradle-conventions).
